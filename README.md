### Hi, I'm Indra! 👋

🇮🇩 Indonesian who lives in 🇲🇾 [Kuala Lumpur](https://www.dbkl.gov.my), [Malaysia](https://www.malaysia.gov.my) ([UTC+8](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/malaysia/kuala-lumpur)).

I'm a full-time Engineering Manager @ [Setel](http://setel.com/) but in my spare time, I do freelance consulting jobs and help small startups fill the role to guide them on executing their ideas into a high-quality product.
